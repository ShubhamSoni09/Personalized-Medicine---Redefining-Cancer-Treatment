# Personalized-Medicine-Machine-Learning

A lot has been said during the past several years about how precise the medicine is and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.

But this is only partially happening due to the huge amount of manual work still required. Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).

This repository contains a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations of cancer based upon data of research text, genes and variations.
